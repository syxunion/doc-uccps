= Enabling kdump

{op-system} ships with `kexec-tools`, but manual configuration is required to enable `kdump`.

.Procedure

Perform the following steps to enable `kdump` on {op-system}:

. To reserve memory for the crash kernel during the first kernel booting, provide kernel arguments by entering the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
# rpm-ostree kargs --append='crashkernel=256M'
----

. Optional: To write the crash dump over the network or to some other location, rather than to the default local `/var/crash` location, edit the `/etc/kdump.conf` configuration file.
+
[NOTE]
====
Network dumps are required when using LUKS. `kdump` does not support local crash dumps on LUKS-encrypted devices.
====
+
For details on configuring the `kdump` service, see the comments in `/etc/sysconfig/kdump`, `/etc/kdump.conf`, and the `kdump.conf` manual page.

. Enable the `kdump` systemd service:
+
[source, terminal]
----
# systemctl enable kdump.service
----

. Reboot your system:
+
[source, terminal]
----
# systemctl reboot
----

. Ensure that `kdump` has loaded a crash kernel by checking that the `kdump.service` has started and exited successfully and that `cat /sys/kernel/kexec_crash_loaded` prints `1`.
