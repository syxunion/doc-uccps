= Investigating kernel crashes

The `kdump` service, included in `kexec-tools`, provides a crash-dumping mechanism. You can use this service to save the contents of the system's memory for later analysis.

The `kdump` service is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[].
