= Understanding how to disable features

You can use the Feature Gates Custom Resource to toggle on and off Technical Preview features throughout your cluster.  

This allows you, for example, to ensure that Technical Preview features are off for production clusters while leaving the features on for test clusters where you can
fully test them.

////
If you disable a feature that appears in the web console, you might see that feature, but
no objects are listed. For example, if you disable builds, you can see the *Builds* tab in the web console, but there are no builds present.

If you attempt to use commands associated with a disabled feature, such as `oc start-build`, {product-title}
displays an error.

[NOTE]
====
If you disable a feature that any application in the cluster relies on, the application might not
function properly, depending upon the feature disabled and how the application uses that feature.
