= Manual migration to new customDeploy install method

A new deployment method introduced in {product-title} 4.10 allows you to customize the network configuration (`networkConfig`) in the `install-config.yaml` file by host during the installation and provisioning process. You can also set static IPs per host and additional advanced network configurations.

When you upgrade to version 4.10, {product-title} is not automatically upgraded to the new deployment method and you need to perform the following manual steps. Although the functioning of {product-title} is not affected, this change is necessary before trying to scale up the cluster.

.Procedure

. Log in to `oc` as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

. Find out what machineSets exists:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machinesets -A
----

. Edit each machineSet:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----

.. Change to include the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  providerSpec:
    value:
      customDeploy:
        method: install_coreos
      image:
        checksum: ""
        url: ""
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The change removes the image `checksum/url` and adds the `customDeploy` field.
