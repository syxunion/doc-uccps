= Disabling Technology Preview features using FeatureGates

If you no longer want to use Technology Preview features, you can disable them.

[NOTE]
====
Turning off Technology Preview features removes the features, but updating
your cluster remains disabled.
====

.Prerequisites

* You added a FeatureGate and enabled Technology Preview features.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You must log in to the cluster with a user that has the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Obtain the name of the Custom Resource for the FeatureGate:
+
----
$ oc get FeatureGate cluster -n openshift-config
NAME      AGE
cluster   18d
----

. Edit the FeatureGate:
.. From the web console, switch to the
*Administration* -> *Custom Resource Definitions* page.

.. On the *Custom Resource Definitions* page, click *FeatureGate*.

.. On the *Custom Resource Definitions* page, click *Actions* and
select *View Instances*.

.. Click the name of the CR for the FeatureGate.

.. On the *FeatureGate Overview* page, click *Actions* and
select *Edit Feature Gate*.

.. To turn off the Technology Preview features, modify the `spec` parameter:
+
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: FeatureGate
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec: {} <1>
----
+
<1> Set the `spec` value to `{}` to disable the Technology Preview features that
prevent you from updating a cluster.
