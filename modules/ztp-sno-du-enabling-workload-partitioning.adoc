= Workload partitioning

{sno-caps} clusters that run DU workloads require workload partitioning. This limits the cores allowed to run platform services, maximizing the CPU core for application payloads.

[NOTE]
====
Workload partitioning can only be enabled during cluster installation. You cannot disable workload partitioning post-installation. However, you can reconfigure workload partitioning by updating the `cpu` value that you define in the performance profile, and in the related `MachineConfig` custom resource (CR).
====

* The base64-encoded CR that enables workload partitioning contains the CPU set that the management workloads are constrained to. Encode host-specific values for `crio.conf` and `kubelet.conf` in base64. Adjust the content to match the CPU set that is specified in the cluster performance profile. It must match the number of cores in the cluster host.

* When configured in the cluster host, the contents of `/etc/crio/crio.conf.d/01-workload-partitioning` should look like this:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[crio.runtime.workloads.management]
activation_annotation = "target.workload.openshift.io/management"
annotation_prefix = "resources.workload.openshift.io"
resources = { "cpushares" = 0, "cpuset" = "0-1,52-53" } <1>
----
<1> The `CPUs` value varies based on the installation.
+
If Hyper-Threading is enabled, specify both threads for each core. The `CPUs` value must match the reserved CPU set specified in the performance profile.

* When configured in the cluster, the contents of `/etc/kubernetes/openshift-workload-pinning` should look like this:
+
[source,terminal]
----
{
  "management": {
    "cpuset": "0-1,52-53" <1>
  }
}
----
<1> The `cpuset` must match the `CPUs` value in `/etc/crio/crio.conf.d/01-workload-partitioning`.
