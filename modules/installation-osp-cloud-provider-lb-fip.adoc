= External load balancers that use pre-defined floating IP addresses

Commonly, {rh-openstack-first} deployments disallow non-administrator users from creating specific floating IP addresses. If such a policy is in place and you use a floating IP address in your service specification, the cloud provider will fail to handle IP address assignment to load balancers.

If you use an external cloud provider, you can avoid this problem by pre-creating a floating IP address and specifying it in your service specification. The in-tree cloud provider does not support this method. 

Alternatively, you can link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6069071[modify the {rh-openstack} Networking service (Neutron) to allow non-administrator users to create specific floating IP addresses].
