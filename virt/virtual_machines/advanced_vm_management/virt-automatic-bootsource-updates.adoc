toc::[]

You can use boot sources that are _system-defined_ and included with {VirtProductName} or _user-defined_, which you create. System-defined boot source imports and updates are controlled by the product feature gate. You can enable, disable, or re-enable updates using the feature gate. User-defined boot sources are not controlled by the product feature gate and must be individually managed to opt in or opt out of automatic imports and updates.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must set a default storage class for automatic import and update of boot sources.
