<1> Specify the channel to get the Operator from. `stable` is the recommended channel.
<2> Specify `Manual` or `Automatic`. In `Automatic` mode, the Operator automatically updates to the latest versions in the channel as they become available in the registry. In `Manual` mode, new Operator versions are installed only after they are explicitly approved.
